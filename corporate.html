          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>The color palette </b>This color combination refers to the information provided to us in the lectures:
              <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #FF914D;"></span>
                  #FF914D
                  <em>This soft orange is the main color of the brand and stands for the real Dutch identity.</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #FFA310;"></span>
                  #FFA310
                  <em>This brighter tangerine orange fits the main color of the brand and contibutes to the leading color. According to psychology, this color means self-confident, which matches our brand identity. </em>
                </li>
				<li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #F6D7AA;"></span>
                  #F6D7AA
                  <em>This pale orange color is used the finish of the color palette. We use this color mainly as backgrounds to remain peace in our page and easy readable text. According to psychology, this pale color reasembles the feelings of excitemen, which is something we want to achieve with our services and brand.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </em>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Font choices</b></li>
			  <ul>
			  <li><em>In social media posts, made through Canva:</em> Bernoru &amp; Genty Sans. Because these fonts were not applicable &amp; abailable to our website, we've found an alternative font that matches the original Bernoru font closely.</li>
			  <li><em>In our website:</em> Gelica for our headings, designed by Dave Rowland, retrieved from <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/gelica">Adobe Fonts.</a></li>
			  <li>We have chosen these fonts since we wanted to achieve a playful learning experience. Because of the rounded edges and playful letters on both he Bernoru &amp; Gelica font, we think that we achieve this effect.</li></ul>
            <li><b>User interface patterns</b></li>
			  <ul>
			  <li>Cards - 6x - We have used these cards for multiple different reasons. On our landing page, we have made us of them as our service providers. By putting it in these containers, we are confident that our services are explained well. In our 'About us' page, we have used them to introduce ourselves to the vistors &amp; audience. By using this container, we think that our audience is able to digest the information more easy.</li>
			  <li>Carousel - 1x - We have used the carousel only on our landing page. We wanted to make sure that it is an exlusive piece of content that shouldn't be distributed many times across the website. By using it at the top of our landing page, we are confident that we are able to explain our brand in the first seconds to our audience.</li>
			  <li>Two column - 1x - We have the same reasoning here just like the carousel. The two column is a nuique type of content which we did not want to overuse on our website. That's why we've chosen to only use it to explain our brand values and the company itself. The two column was most applicable for this page &amp; content. </li></ul>
            <li><b>The structure of the navigation &amp; content</b></li>
			  <ul>
			  <li>We found readibility and overview really imporant on our website. That's why we've chosen to distribute the content on different pages. Besides that, we found multiple unique tools, such as the carousel and two colums, which made it more easy to make the content readable and to distribute it across the different pages. </li>
			   <li><em>Home page -</em> On our home page we start with the carousel which briefly explains our brand in pictures. After that we define it even more to the audience with our logo and contibuting text. We end the explanation of our brand with the 3 cards explaining our different services. In this way, people know our brand without to much reading. Most of the items speak for itself.</li>
			  <li><em>About us page -</em> On the about us page, we wanted to explain the values and vision of the brand firs before we started introducing ourselves. That's why we've used the two column and made an easy overview of those aspects. After that, we used the clear cards again to explain some brief information about ourselves.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
			 <li><em>Funding page -</em> We wanted to keep our funding page easy &amp; short. That's why we've provided a link that leads you to a real funding page for our brand. All of the information about funding would be displayed there to make things easy. </li>  
			  </ul>
            <li><b>Relation to elements of other units</b>
              <ul>
				  <li>The overall personality of the brand is playful. That's why we've chosen fonts to match that appearance. By using the different design elements and the combination with our color palette, we are confident that we reached this playful appearance.</li>
				  <li> The marketing and communication strategy is in the end to spread our reach &amp; gain followers. That's why we've provided our social media links of our active platforms (Facebook &amp; Instagram) at the footer of each page. In this way, there is an indirect call to action for our followers if they're interested in the brand.</li>
				   <li> We showcase the product (or service in this case) on the first page of the website. This website helps explaining our product by placing it in a easy readable container, the cards. In combination with our social media platforms, this website makes one cohesive piece of our brand, products and values.</li>
